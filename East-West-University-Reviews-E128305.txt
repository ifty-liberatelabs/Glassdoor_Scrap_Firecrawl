CEO approval
Business outlook
Pros
Many students come from urban low income background and East-West gives them quality education and a chance for social mobility. Majority of students are enthusiastic and fun, and are very strong people who progress in the face of circumstances.
Cons
East-West needs a more streamlined registration process, students should not register late, and classes should get closed on time to avoid overloading.

Pros
East West is very good at working with its teachers' schedules and is very thorough in providing necessary resources in and outside of the classroom.
Cons
The only downside I can see is not being paid enough money so that teachers don't have to work more than one job.

Pros
Helping work colleagues and students
Cons
This institution is being run as a personal domain. Everything is controlled by the office of Provost. She has been working here since school open doors 42 years ago. She makes decisions on her whims, lacks management skills and professionalism. University is struggling with enrollment and locked in a revolving door syndrome. University will not prosper as long as two old guards are managing it.

Lovable but disorganized
Anonymous employee
Current employee
Chicago, IL
Recommend

Business outlook
Pros
It's located just south of the Loop in Chicago, and it's right by Grant Park. They are small, and if you work hard there is a lot of opportunity for advancement. Many of the employees are true believers in the cause, which is to serve a population that's left behind by other colleges. The students can often be counted on to brighten your day. Many students come from difficult circumstances, and to see how hard they work will make you want to give it your all.
Cons
The pay is low, and the benefits are generally below standard. This is a low cost university, and employees share in that burden. Micromanaging is common in some departments. It is generally chaotic and disorganized. It can seem like many deliverables are last minute and ill conceived. Getting something done can often require giving an excessive amount of reminders to your coworkers.

Pros
There are 0 positive experiences I have to share. Having a couple great co-workers was the only way I could get through my day.
Cons
The Admissions Team was hired on around the same time frame. All of us were deceived that the role we were accepting was “Associate Director Of Admissions” when it was really Admissions Counselor.  The health insurance is horrible- and if you dare leave 3 minutes early you will be told by a veteran empolyee to be careful because the provost watches the clock like a hawk. The atmosphere is dull and depressing. If you want to work in a positive and upbeat environment and feel valued DO NOT WORK HERE.

No HR department, provost has strict control over this area. Your lunch break will be at your desk as you can’t take one at times. Personnel is always changing.
