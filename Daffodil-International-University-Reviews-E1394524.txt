Recommend

Pros
There is literally not a single good thing about this institution
Cons
- Very poor salary and increment structure 
- Extreme politics among academic professionals 
- Management treats teachers like animals
- If you don’t lick the foot of your superiors you cannot sustain 
- Extreme work pressure, 18 credits per term
- Useless course creation is to be done with any remuneration for uni’s sister concern
- Extremely bad location
- Teaching is the least important thing, the most important one is to show off and please the management 
- Female teachers get exposure as the head of the department and the dean are perverts
- Teachers change students result and give them better marks which they do not deserve 
- They hold off teachers fees and capitalise in them by taking interest from bank
- The systems are extremely scattered and for ever task you have to open a new account in a different site
- You have update each and every work you do daily and add them on a system, this takes a lot of tole on the teachers thus they cannot focus on work and research

Exploring the Academic Landscape: An In-Depth Review of Daffodil International University
Graduate student
Former employee
Dhaka
Recommend
CEO approval
Business outlook
Pros
Academic Programs: DIU may offer a diverse range of academic programs, including undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, providing students with various options to pursue their interests and career goals.

Accreditation: If DIU is accredited by reputable accreditation bodies, it ensures that the university meets certain academic standards, providing assurance of the quality of education.

Facilities and Infrastructure: Positive aspects may include well-equipped classrooms, modern laboratories, libraries, and other facilities that contribute to a conducive learning environment.

Faculty Qualifications: The qualifications and expertise of the faculty can significantly impact the quality of education. A university with experienced and well-qualified faculty members is often viewed positively.

Research Opportunities: If DIU encourages and supports research activities, it can be a positive aspect, especially for students interested in academic exploration and innovation.
Cons
Accreditation Issues: If there are concerns about the accreditation status of DIU, it could impact the perceived quality of education and recognition of degrees.

Faculty Quality: If there are issues with the qualifications, expertise, or teaching quality of the faculty members, it may affect the overall learning experience.

Infrastructure and Facilities: Insufficient or outdated facilities, classrooms, laboratories, or libraries may hinder the learning environment and overall student experience.

Limited Research Opportunities: If DIU does not prioritize or provide adequate support for research activities, students interested in research-oriented careers may find it limiting.

Lack of International Exposure: Limited opportunities for international collaboration, exchange programs, or exposure to a diverse range of perspectives may be a concern for some students.

Good enough to start your career and not the place where you want to retire
Lecturer
Former employee, more than 3 years
Dhaka
Recommend
CEO approval
Business outlook
Pros
Fast paced environment with very little competition if you want to climb the ranks. The university has done well to rise from most of its mediocrity. At one point- they were famous for selling certificates. However- things are more standardized these days and you cannot pass without going through all assessments. Some of the faculty members are extremely hard working and easy going. Having conversations with them in the lounge might be great for those in early-career.
Cons
1. The recruitment policy is absolute trash. People often get recruited for either being an alumni or belonging to Chandpur (many jokingly call it chandpur university because of the number of people working here who are from Chandpur). I found a guy being recruited as a lecturer just because of his parents' connection to the authorities. There is very little to learn from those recruited through unfair means, and they often create hindrances for those around them. 2. The chairman Khan is too hands on! He does not have expertise in academia and often tries to utilize his experience (of failed businesses- Daffodil Computers, Green Garden, Skills.jobs etc. runs from the revenue of current students in different methods). I once witnessed him saying he will kick the VC and registrar if they cannot make the teachers work according to his satisfaction. Interestingly the VC took the mic soon after and kept praising the chairman. Ironically VC and registrar both got sacked eventually 3. There is very little reward for working 45 hours a week. The salary and benefits come nowhere close to its counterparts with better reputation in the country. Therefore good teachers and admin members often leave their jobs the first opportunity they get. 3. The employee protection schemes are basically non-existent. While leaving the job I had to pay two months of salary before getting my experience letter. They did not provide any receipts and I had to visit roughly 9 times to the remote village area to collect all the documents. 4. The university claims to be a top contender in rankings but in most of the metrics you will find heavy manipulation. Very difficult to be taken seriously if you introduce yourself as an employee of DIU. 5. Almost all the students foster deep disregard for hard work. Most of them find it difficult to believe that you can get a good job on yours efforts alone and do not need lobbying. Took me a while to explain to some of the alumni that I am not HR and I do not have any control over the recruitment at my current office. 6. Exploitation in various ways is also very common- especially difficult for women working here. Sometimes the salary is kept stuck under atrocious excuses(ex- the chairman is abroad and he could not sign the cheque or- the employees' performances are bad and he will sign the check later after talking to everyone and collecting bank interest). Huge respect for those who have been working here and surviving. They are inhumanely strong.

Business outlook
Pros
I've had the privilege of working at Daffodil International University (DIU) for the past few years, and I can confidently say that it has been an exceptional experience. The work environment at DIU is truly remarkable. The institution's commitment to fostering a positive and collaborative atmosphere is evident in every aspect of its operations. One of the standout features of DIU is its dedication to providing competitive salary structures. Unlike many other institutions, DIU truly values its employees and ensures that they are compensated fairly for their hard work. This not only boosts morale but also serves as a testament to the university's commitment to employee well-being. DIU's emphasis on professional development is another noteworthy aspect. The university offers ample opportunities for growth through workshops, seminars, and training programs. This not only enables personal skill enhancement but also contributes to the overall growth of the institution.
Cons
While Daffodil International University excels in numerous areas, there are a few minor areas that could be improved. The administrative processes, though efficient, could benefit from streamlining in certain aspects. Additionally, while the work environment is generally positive, certain departments might need a more proactive approach to team-building activities to further enhance collaboration.

If job was not scare in Bangladesh no body would work there.
Lecturer
Current employee, more than 1 year
Bangla, Dhaka
Recommend
CEO approval
Business outlook
Pros
1. You will be teaching students with a very poor academic background.  So teaching is really super easy because you do not have to go deep
2. Time can be flexible 
3. An actual workload is not that significant. So go and teach something. you should be ok. 
4.  You may find some good colleagues.
Cons
1. Almost entire management is from a specific district of Bangladesh. They will treat you badly even you are highly educated. 

2. Very often the big boss "chairman" will inject BS to you in a public speaking manner. He will make sure you understand that he is in a superior position. Even though he is a businessman, he is going to lecture you about the teaching method. He is going to confidently tell you "How to speak English" in very wrong English. 

3. Even though you may be an awesome athlete, DIU will force you to go for another BS event called "Change together" and make you "dance" in the name of physical exercise.

4. Its business organization, not a university. They treat their student very badly.
5. You will find tons of fawning people who are busy trying to be in the spotlight.  They are going to give a lot of BS ideas and try to be intellectual.

Poor management and academic personal relationship
Lecturer
Former employee, more than 1 year
Dhaka
Recommend
CEO approval
Business outlook
Pros
If you have plans to go for higher studies and make preparations during your job life. The academic position is best suited for you. You can start your career in DIU and make preparations and try to go abroad within 2 years or change the job. DIU is not a good place for long time employment.
Cons
Extra work for which you won't get paid.
During the COVID lockdown, the management started cutting the salaries of its employee. It was never mentioned in the prior contract nor it's ethical. 
They used metrics to evaluate an employee each month and disburse salary based on the review (which was vague and never revealed how the metrics are being calculated, they just provided a document about points breakdown and every month just like that some salaries are being deducted). 
The most unethical task given is to ask advising students for tuition fees.

Poor teacher and students ratio per course, though each section is limited to 40 students but it is never the case, there will always be some extra students per section sometimes it crosses over 50 for which you won't get any extra pay. 
You will get remuneration for extra credit but if the section size is below 30 then -1 credit payment will be deducted from the remuneration (during lockdown everyone faculty member had to take 3 credits extra without pay).

Worst Educational Institute You Can Join
Lecturer
Current employee, less than 1 year
Recommend
CEO approval
Business outlook
Pros
The Campus is green, and you can breathe there (if you can overlook the cons, though, which is very much unlikely).
Cons
DIU management is basically a cult led by their chairman, who is kind of a religious figure to the nepotism-driven authority. Most of the students getting enrolled there lack the basic foundation. And even if they manage to have some good students, the weird and unorganized system doesn't provide the teachers enough scope to make them well educated. 

"Leadership," "Ownership" - these are some buzzwords that you are going to hear there all day long. But in reality, those are a bunch of monkeys who learned those words watching some cringy YouTube motivation speakers.
