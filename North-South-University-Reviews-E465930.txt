Flexibility and Comparatively high Salary, provided you can cope with the mismanagement!
Lecturer

Dhaka
Recommend
CEO approval
Business outlook
Pros
Higher salary compared to other private universities in the country. All instructors get a private office room. A great deal of flexibility is available as far as course content and classes are concerned. Students are better behaved than public universities.
Cons
Management is shaky to say the least. They will change policies and guidelines at their whim and you will have to cope with that. If you are employed as an instructor at the School of Business, expect to teach and grade around 200 students per semester. No TAs are allowed for undergraduate level faculty members.

1. Flexible work hours and work-life balance. 2. Neat and clean beautiful campus 3. Labs and classrooms are well equipped though there is a room for improvement.
Cons
1. Extremely poor salary (around 250 BDT/hour) for part-time lab instructors and salary is given every two months. 2. There is no yearly increment or bonus or anything at all. 3. After every 2 months, employees have to submit there last two months of working and office hours in an excel sheet with an application for their last two months salary. Then the admin would start salary processing.

Almost no work if the professor is chill Just sit in your air-conditioned room for 3-5 hours a week with a desktop with ethernet
